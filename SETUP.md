3. Test the highlighting functionality

### Customizing Job Detection

Edit the `sponsoredKeywords` array in:
- `packages/extension/src/content.ts`
- `packages/extension/src/background.ts`

### Database Schema

The Convex schema includes:
- `users`: User profiles linked to Clerk
- `jobs`: Job postings with metadata

- `jobAlerts`: Future feature for job alerts

## Deployment

### Web Application
```bash
cd packages/web
npm run build
# Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or your preferred platform
```

### Convex Backend
```bash
cd packages/convex
npm run build
# Automatically deployed via Convex CLI
```

### Chrome Extension
```bash
cd packages/extension
npm run build
# Submit to Chrome Web Store
```

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working
- Check if the extension is enabled in Chrome
- Verify the manifest.json permissions
- **Configure Convex URL in extension settings**
- Check browser console for errors
- **Ensure sponsored companies exist in the Convex database**
- Verify company names match between job sites and database (use aliases for variations)

### Web App Authentication Issues

### Backend Connection Issues
- Ensure Convex is running (`npm run dev`)
- Verify CONVEX_URL in environment variables
- Check Convex dashboard for deployment status
